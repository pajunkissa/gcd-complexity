This is a demonstration of the time complexities of different algorithms
to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers. We consider the
time complexity as a function of the size of the input (bits needed to 
represent the numbers) and the unit of time is arithmetic operations and
comparisons that can be done in O(n^2) and O(n) bit operations,
respectively.

The purpose of this demostration is to show that for tractable problems,
i.e. problems that can be solved in polynomial time, there exists both
feasible and infeasible algorithms, i.e. algorithms that run in
polynomial time and those that don't.

The program uses the matplotlib library for visualization.
